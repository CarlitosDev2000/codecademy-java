he if keyword marks the beginning of the conditional statement, followed by parentheses ().
The parentheses hold a boolean datatype.
For the condition in parentheses we can also use variables that reference a boolean, or comparisons that evaluate to a boolean.

The boolean condition is followed by opening and closing curly braces that mark a block of code. This block runs if, and only if, the boolean is true.
