While this method works just fine, we had to write our variable numCupcakes twice. We can shorten this syntax by using a compound assignment operator.

Compound assignment operators perform an arithmetic operation on a variable and then reassigns its value. Using the += compound assignment operator, we can rewrite our previous code like so:

numCupcakes += 8; // Value is now 20
Now we only need to reference numCupcakes once.

We can use compound assignment operators for all of the arithmetic operators weâ€™ve covered:

Addition (+=)
Subtraction (-=)
Multiplication (*=)
Division (/=)
Modulo (%=)

nunca usar esto, es poco profesional ;

numCupcakes = numCupcakes + 8; // Value is now 20
